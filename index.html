    <div>
      <p>
        Java is a widely-used, high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in 1995. It was designed to be platform-independent, which means that code written in Java can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This principle is known as "write once, run anywhere."</p>
      <h3>Key Features of Java</h3>
    <ol><li>Object-Oriented: Java follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which facilitate code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.</li>
        <li> Platform Independence: Java programs are designed to be platform-independent at both the source and binary levels. This is achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets compiled Java bytecode, allowing it to run on any device with a JVM.
        </li>
        <li>Automatic Memory Management: Java includes automatic garbage collection, which helps manage memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the likelihood of memory leaks and other memory-related issues.
        </li>
        <li>Rich Standard Library: Java comes with a comprehensive standard library, known as the Java Standard Edition (Java SE), which provides a wide range of pre-built classes and methods for tasks such as data structures, networking, file I/O, and graphical user interface (GUI) development.
        </li>
        <li>Multithreading: Java supports multithreading, which allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a program. This is useful for developing applications that require simultaneous execution of tasks, such as games or real-time applications.
        </li>
        <li>security: Java has a robust security model, including features like bytecode verification, sandboxing, and the Java Security Manager, which help protect against malicious code and ensure secure execution of applications.
        </li>
        <li> Performance: Java uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to convert bytecode into native machine code at runtime, improving performance. The language is also optimized for performance through various JVM tuning and optimization techniques.
        </li>
        <li>Community and Ecosystem: Java benefits from a large and active community of developers, as well as a rich ecosystem of frameworks, tools, and libraries. Popular frameworks include Spring, Hibernate, and Apache Struts, which extend Java's capabilities and simplify development.</li>
